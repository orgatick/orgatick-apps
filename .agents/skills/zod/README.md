# Zod Skill

Created by **[Anivar Aravind](https://anivar.net)**

An AI agent skill for writing, validating, and debugging Zod v4 schemas with modern best practices.

## The Problem

AI agents often generate outdated Zod v3 patterns — `z.string().email()` instead of `z.email()`, `z.nativeEnum()` instead of the unified `z.enum()`, `required_error` instead of the `error` parameter — and miss critical parsing pitfalls like using `parse()` instead of `safeParse()`, forgetting `parseAsync` for async refinements, or assuming `z.object()` preserves unknown keys. These produce schemas that compile but silently misbehave at runtime.

## This Solution

27 rules with incorrect→correct code examples that teach agents Zod v4's actual API behavior, schema design patterns, error handling, architectural placement, observability, and TypeScript integration. Each rule targets a specific mistake and shows exactly how to fix it.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add anivar/zod-skill -g
```

Testing schemas is covered too, merged from the former `zod-testing` skill —
see `references/testing.md`.

Or with full URL:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/anivar/zod-skill
```

## Baseline

- zod ^4.3.0 (tracks 4.4.x; audited against zod.dev, August 2026)
- TypeScript ^5.5

The skill is checked against Zod's own documentation rather than its release
notes, which matters more than it sounds: several APIs announced in 4.3
releases — `slugify`, `.with()`, `.apply()`, `.overwrite()`, `.register()` —
have no presence in the documentation, and a skill that taught them would be
teaching an interface the project has not committed to.

## What's Inside

### 27 Rules Across 9 Categories

| Priority | Category | Rules | Impact |
|----------|----------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Parsing & Type Safety | 3 | CRITICAL |
| 2 | Schema Design | 4 | CRITICAL |
| 3 | Refinements & Transforms | 3 | HIGH |
| 4 | Error Handling | 3 | HIGH |
| 5 | Performance & Composition | 3 | MEDIUM |
| 6 | v4 Migration | 3 | MEDIUM |
| 7 | Advanced Patterns | 3 | MEDIUM |
| 8 | Architecture & Boundaries | 3 | CRITICAL/HIGH |
| 9 | Observability | 2 | HIGH/MEDIUM |

Each rule file contains:
- Why it matters
- Incorrect code with explanation
- Correct code with explanation
- Decision tables and additional context
